# OVERVIEW
Dana is a data journalist who is given an assignment to write about her home town McMinnville, Oregon.<br> McMinnville is famous for its sightings and even has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts. She is really excited 
about this topic as it had already caught her attention during childhood when she read about an article on Farmer TRENT sighting back in 1950.

The only data that she has available is a java script file with siting information. She is going to use her knowledge in html and javascript to display sightings data and also make it dynamic to allow the visitor to filter data on data, city, state, country and shape.
